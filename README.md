# Sandwich Maker  
Exercise in modules  
### Description  
Project is version 1 of the assignment.  
Was an independent exercise in using modules and data getter functions.  
Version 2 will add functionality for all ingredients. Currently only bread options are fully functional.  
User can select desired options and click Make Sandwich to see table readout of all selected ingredients with their categories and prices.  A total price also prints.  
When Make Sandwich is clicked, all selected options clear and if new options are selected and MS is clicked again, a fresh readout appears.  
Used features such as data getter functions, objects, switch statements, etc. as part of exercise.  
Example problem solved: How to reset the arrays to empty so that a clean readout prints every time.
